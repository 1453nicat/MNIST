# MNIST

# Overview
The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset) is a widely used dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, used primarily for training and testing models for digit recognition.

# Key Features:
Images: Size: 28x28 pixels.
Format: Grayscale (values range from 0 to 255).
Classes: Labels: Digits from 0 to 9 (10 classes).
Dataset Composition: 
    Training Set: 60,000 images.
    Test Set: 10,000 images.
Preprocessing: Pixel values are typically normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.

# Libraries
- numpy and pandas
- seaborn and matplotlib
- keras (tensorflow)
- scikit-learn
